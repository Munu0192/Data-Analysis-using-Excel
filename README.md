Data Analytics using Excel
1.	Using Excel, I have carried out Sales Analysis of different products for the company, Awesome Chocolates on the basis of different demographical locations and sales figure of different Sales person in those locations. Have also listed out Top 5 products having highest Sales per unit globally as well as listing out best sales person from each location. 
2.	Have also prepared a Dynamic Country Level Sales Report to check the operational condition of Awesome Chocolates in different locations and considering the Total Profit Percent we could able to determine the loss making products in different locations which could be discontinued to improved the Net Profit Percentage.
3.	The data source had information regarding the geographical locations, product names, sales figure of each product in different locations and no.of units sold in each location. The cost per unit item of each product has also been provided in the data source.
4.	I have analyzed the total sales figure of different locations and no.of units sold in each location using Pivot Table. And using slicers, we could able to analyze the performance of every sales person in different geographical location.

6.	 Have also found out Top 5 products on the basis of Sales per unit. And sales per unit value is not directly provided in the source table. And for this reason, while using the Pivot Table, we must add the data table to data model so that we can add new measures into the pivot table. And then I have added ‘Sales per unit’ measure. And using SORT option, the products were sorted from largest to smallest. And using FILTER option, Top 5 products were displayed.

8.	Have also found out ‘Best Sales Person of each Location’, using PIVOT TABLE. And using SORT and FILTER option to find out best sales person of each location.

10.	Have also calculated the ‘Total Profit’ of each product using PIVOT TABLE. But for that we need to calculate the manufacturing cost of the product. And as we have a separate table showing values of cost per unit of each product, using ‘INDEX & MATCH’ function we displayed the cost per unit value for each product in our data table and then calculated the cost of manufacturing. And using PIVOT TABLE, I added a new measure of ‘Total Profit’ that is incurred for each product and using SLICERS we can also bifurcate the Total Profit earned by each sales person for a given product.

12.	Have also prepared a dynamic Country Level Sales Report, that basically gives information regarding the status of Awesome Chocolates in different countries.

14.	Using PIVOT TABLE, have also calculated the Profit Percentage of each product. And considering that the firm is targeting for minimum of 30% as profit percentage we can also suggest discontinuing of certain products in different demographic location.
